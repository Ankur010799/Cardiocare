Lifestyle changes- Healthy lifestyle choices can help you prevent heart disease. They can also help you treat the condition and prevent it from getting worse. e.g. getting regular exercise, reducing alcohol consumption and quitting tobacco can help treat heart disease.

Medications- A medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or control your heart disease, or it may also be prescribed to slow or stop the risk for complications. The exact drug you’re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have.

Surgery- In some cases of heart disease, surgery or a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms.The procedure your doctor will perform depends on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart.</span><span  class="e90_16">treatment options..</span></div><div class=e90_11><span  class="e90_2">Most of the major CVD risk factors can be controlled by leading a healthy lifestyle. Here are a few ways:

Become active- Try to make exercise a regular part of your life, e.g. use the stairs instead of the lift. Being active is also a great way to relieve stress and control your weight, which are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Stop smoking- If you stop smoking, your risk of coronary heart disease will be halved within a year and will return to a normal level over time. Avoid smoke-filled environments: exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the risk of heart attack.

Know your numbers- Have your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels checked regularly. High blood pressure is the number one risk factor for stroke. High blood cholesterol and glucose levels can also place you at greater risk.

Eat healthily- A proper diet and nutrition play a major role in reducing the risks of heart disease.</span><div  class="e90_10"></div><span  class="e90_1">how to prevent CVDs..</span></div><div class=e85_21><div  class="e82_4"></div><span  class="e82_3">The tests you’ll need to diagnose your heart disease depend on what condition your doctor thinks you might have. Irrespective of the type of heart disease you might have, you doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your personal and family medical history before doing any tests. Apart from blood tests and a chest X-ray scan, other tests used to diagnose heart diseases can include:

-Electrocardiogram (ECG).

-Echocardiogram.

-Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

-Cardiac Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan.

-Cardiac Catheterization.

-Holter Monitoring.

-Stress Test.



</span><span  class="e82_2">how to diagnose..</span></div><div class=e85_20><span  class="e76_4">Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first warning of an underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:

-pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest.

-pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.

-additionally, the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; feeling sick or vomiting; feeling light-headed or faint; breaking into a cold sweat; and becoming pale. Women are more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.

Symptoms of a heart stroke include:

-sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body.

-other symptoms might include the sudden onset of confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech;difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination;severe headache with no known cause; andfainting or unconsciousness.

People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately.</span><div  class="e76_28"></div><span  class="e76_3">the symptoms..</span></div><div class=e90_31><div  class="e90_30"></div><span  class="e90_25">There are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable, and others aren’t. 

Some of the controllable risk factors include:
-high blood pressure.
-smoking.
-obesity.
-physical inactivity.
-high cholesterol levels.

Diabetic people may also be at higher risk for heart disease because high blood glucose levels increase the risk of angina, heart attack, stroke or CAD.


Other risk factors which can’t be controlled include:
-family history
-ethnicity
-sex
-age

Although these factors can’t be controlled, they need to be monitored carefully.</span><span  class="e90_24">the risk factors for CVDs..</span></div><div class=e76_1><span  class="e61_7">Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. These diseases include the following:

-Coronary heart disease: disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

-Cerebrovascular disease: refers to a group of conditions, diseases, and disorders that affect the blood vessels and blood supply to the brain.

-Peripheral artery disease: a circulatory condition in which narrowed blood vessels reduce blood flow to the limbs.

-Rheumatic heart disease: damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria.

-Congenital heart disease: defect in the structure of the heart, that is present at birth.

-Pulmonary embolism: blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. In most cases, it is caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from deep veins in the legs.

Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain.
