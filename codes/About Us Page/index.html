We are developing this website as our semester project. 
Although you can reach out to us by mail, here’s our address in case you wish to visit us :)</span><span  class="e102_2">who are we?</span></div><div class=e102_12><span  class="e102_13">why was this made?</span><span  class="e102_14">CVDs cause the most number of deaths globally, taking about 17.9 million lives each year. According to the official WHO site, more than 75% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Most of the people in these countries might be unaware of the risks they face. Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receiveappropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.
Our website aims to do the same, i.e. raise awareness about CVDs and help to identify high risk individuals.
Additionally, COVID-19 is known to have particularly deleterious effects on those with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, so it’s more important than ever to develop a web-based platform so that everyone can access this from the safety of their homes.</span></div><div class=e106_1><span  class="e106_2">what is this site?</span><span  class="e106_3">Cardiocare- as the name suggests, is about care of the heart. In fact, it’s not just about the heart but almost everything that is affected by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We aim to make people aware about CVDs, the serious risks they pose and how we can prevent them.
Our main attraction is the Test section, where you can enter some basic data and find out if you face the risks of a cardiovascular disease.
